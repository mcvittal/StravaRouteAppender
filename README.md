# StravaRouteAppender
Auto fetches new routes from your Strava profile and appends them to an existing map displaying your previous routes in GeoJSON format.

Strava data fetching uses a slightly modified version of https://github.com/ryanbaumann/Strava-Stream-to-CSV 

GeoJSON simplification is done using the simplify.py library from https://github.com/omarestrella/simplify.py
